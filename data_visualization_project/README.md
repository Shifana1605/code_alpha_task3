# Data Visualization Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the power of data visualization by turning raw sales data into meaningful insights through a bar chart.

## How It Works
1. The data is stored either in a CSV file (`data.csv`) or as hardcoded values.
2. The Python script (`main.py`) uses `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to create a bar chart.
3. The chart is saved as `sales_chart.png` and included in the report (`report.md`).

## Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Running the Project
1. Install the required libraries: `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn`.
2. Run the `main.py` script to generate the chart and report.

## Conclusion
This project highlights how data visualization can quickly turn raw data into clear, actionable insights.
